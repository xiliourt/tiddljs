For proof of concept, tried implementing with tidarr. It appears it would work (config import works, downloadUrl instead of running tiddl works, even managed to get some status updates to the UI).

Crashed because the incomplete path doesnt exist, also many changes to address errors around missing params / not being in docker. Just storing it here as an archive

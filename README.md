This is very much in the development phase, it shoudln't be used in prod without heavy changes and further testing. It's more a proof of concept for now.

The aim is to have a js version of tiddl, for use with web interfaces mainly (ie react + expressjs). Main features are intended as auth/login, auth/logout, auth/refresh and download. 

Config file management and features are aimed to be similar to and/or the same as tiddl.
